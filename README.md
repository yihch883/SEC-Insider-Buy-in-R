The filings down-loader using ticker, it can be a single stock or a list of stock, and you can specify the time period you want to download

## What is under development?
There is an early version of data extraction and construction. It is not perfect at the moment, but you can use the value column as reference.
In Develop in Progress.R you can find below stuffs.
Function to automatic read filing text files.
Function to construct data frame with all necessary data for this project(Date, Transaction Type, Price, Quantity,etc)
Function to construct data frame that consist sell and purchase behavior.

## Please note that although the code is capable of downloading the filing within a loop. It is NOT recommended to do so.
To allow for equitable access to all users, SEC reserves the right to limit requests originating from undeclared automated tools. By doing so, your request might be identified as part of a network automated tools outside the acceptable policy and will be managed until action is taken to declare your traffic.

There is a workaround such as changing IP and adding system.sleep between downloads. However, downloading a reasonable amount at once is still recommended.
